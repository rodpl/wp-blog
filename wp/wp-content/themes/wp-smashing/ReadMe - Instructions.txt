Installation Instructions

   1. Download and extract wp-smashing-latest.zip.
   2. Upload the wp-content folder to the folder wordpress 
      is installed. (It is okay to merge/overwrite if asked 
      by your FTP program)
   4. Activate the wp-smashing plugin.
   3. Activate the wp-smashing theme.




Usage Notes

    * WP SMASHING was built for WordPress 2.7+, but it will
      probably work with versions all the way down to 2.0.
      This has not been checked though.
    * Your WP SMASHING Settings page can be found in your admin
      control panel at the bottom of your sidebar.
    * WP SMASHING utilizes several special functions to operate. With
      a little poking around you will easily be able to customize
      them to display whatever information you want.
    * WP SMASHING is configured to operate WITH the aid of a plugin,
      much like it's sister theme WP CALENDAR. Without this plugin,
      the theme will fail to operate so it's important to install it.
    * WP SMASHING uses a variation of the_excerpt_reloaded. If you
      already have this function installed, WP SMASHING's version
      of it will be overridden by your own.



Know Issues

   [Safari]
      There is a bug with the jScrollPane plugin used to allow the
      calendar days to scroll content. I am working with the plugin
      author to solve this issue and it will be patched in a future
      release.

   [ie6 images]
      Internet Explorer < 6 doesn't display png's properly.
